# objectDetectionRepos
This repository is where we are going to store progress with our object detection portion before we have full functionality.

Main tasks for this portion of our project include...

- Provide smooth video output before a picture is taken to make the picture process easier
- Only run object detection once the user takes the picture to prevent overloading Pi resources

- Main task is to get object detection communicating with the Pi local software seamlessly
